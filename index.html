	<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
	<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

	<p>
		
		Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copmies of <cite>Nature, New Scientist,</cite>
		and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <dfn>On the Road.</dfn>It has been Molly's favourite
		book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
	</p>

	<p>
		She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaming that <abbr>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</abbr>. Althought many considerationd her pioneering work, unraveling  the secrets of the Ilama  <abbr 
 title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement. Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do

	<h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>
			 <p>Eggs are one of my favourite foods. Here is a 
			 recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.</p>
			
	 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
			 <ul>
			 <li>2 eggs</li>
			 <li>1tbs butter</li>
			 <li>2tbs cream</li>
			 </ul>
	<h2>Method</h2>
			 <ol>
			 <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium 
			 heat</li>

			 <li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</li>
			 <li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs</li>
			 <li>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of 
			 the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if 
			 you are making an omelette)</li>
			 <li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the 
			 heat (it will continue to cook on the plate 
			 until served)</li>
			 </ol>
